    "In this section, I will train a Doc2Vec model in order to embed every petition in a vector space. Doc2vec (aka paragraph2vec, aka sentence embeddings) modifies the word2vec algorithm to unsupervised learning of continuous representations for larger blocks of text, such as sentences, paragraphs or entire documents. Since the Doc2Vec class extends original Word2Vec class, many of the usage patterns are similar. One can easily adjust the dimension of the representation, the size of the sliding window, the number of workers, or almost any other parameter that you can change with the Word2Vec model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one exception to this rule are the parameters relating to the training method used by the model. In the word2vec architecture, the two algorithm names are “continuous bag of words” (cbow) and “skip-gram” (sg); in the doc2vec architecture, the corresponding algorithms are “distributed memory” (dm) and “distributed bag of words” (dbow). Since the distributed memory model performed noticeably better in the paper, that algorithm is the default when running Doc2Vec. You can still force the dbow model if you wish, by using the dm=0 flag in constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training the Doc2Vec model a number of pre-processing steps are requires. First, we will need to convert the encoding to utf-8. Then we will have to exclude punctuations and stopwords, do lemmartization or stemming, and make lists of separated words. We will then convert every word to lower case. After these steps, we will be able to train the Doc2Vec model."

The similarity between the first and second petition (both about drugs) and the third and fourth petitions (both related to student loan) are significantly higher than other cases. In the next few steps, I will create a visualization where every petition is represented as a point. To this end, I will reduce the dimantions of every document resulted from Doc2Vec to two dimensions with X and Y coordinates. Although we will lose some information at this step, but it enables us to get a sense of petitions and their similarities."

Condemnations of new war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide are necessary, but not sufficient. \\r\\n\\r\\n8 years after the start of the Darfur genocide, it is time for escalated action by the US to stop the genocides and mass atrocities in Sudan.\",\"Only 6 states, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont, plus the District of Columbia, currently legally allow same-sex couples to get married and have the same benefits as heterosexual couples.

Fortunately, great strides have been made in election technology toward transparency and verifiability. If each voter receives an encrypted receipt, every vote can be published publicly while still maintaining voter privacy, any independent party can tally the results to verify the outcome, and votes can't be lost, stolen, or changed since each voter can electronically verify that their receipt matches their vote.

These companies might choose NOT to release this information to us, the patients, as it might adversely affect their sales of medication to treat our diseases.  If they own them, they may also choose to keep the cures OFF of the market.  It seems it is not illegal for these companies to do this.

However, the FAA elected to exempt all-cargo airlines such as UPS, FedEx, and Atlas because they feel like it's okay for a cargo planes to crash more frequently.  The FAA attaches a value of $6.2 Million to each human life, and have ruled that the cost to these corporations to include them in the new rules have exceeded $6.2M per life they expect to save.  As cold as that sounds, FAA's logic is flawed and a good read of their regulatory impact analysis shows costs have been greatly overstated while benefits have been greatly understated.  They assume 1 crash will only kill the crew, ignoring a potential catastrophe a large cargo jet crash can cause. \",\"Radar data confirms Unidentified Aerial Objects were flying above Stephenville, Texas on January 8th, 2008.

These are educated students that have been working towards a bright future. This is their home, this is all they know.

Students who transfer as a result of school closings could initially lose up to 6 months in academic achievement. Under-performing neighborhood schools are typically replaced by charter schools that perform no better. It takes at least 5 years for new schools to fully develop. In some districts nearly 40% of charters have experienced serious cash flow problems, and a significant number are having difficulty complying with state-mandated pension funding requirements.  Across the nation, it is expected that 15% of charter schools will fail.  Low-income minority students, who are already struggling, cannot afford such instability. \",\"The United States is one of the few countries left in the world who still have not converted to using the Metric System as a standardized system of measurement.

Hence, Tax Policy Favors Buying Two Houses as Opposed to Investing in Education.

If prisoners can be given three meals per a day we can afford to feed our children at least one meal per a day during the 180 calendar days children attend school in the United States. This will greatly help reduce childhood hunger issues. \",\"Endometriosis is a debilitating, invisible illness that effects over 176 million women worldwide. Women with Endo have to deal with severe chronic pain daily. Pain that can be so bad that it's impossible to get out of bed. Endo also causes Chronic Fatigue and Infertility.

Now, I'm 19, and I'm still trying to figure out how to live with it on a day-to-day basis.

This area is simply too reliant on the tourism brought in by the lake to survive without it. Lake Texoma is also home to many species, endangered and non-endangered alike.\",\"On January 28th, 2014 Pittsburgh Police K9 Rocco was stabbed during the apprehension of a suspect that had led police on a vehicle chase. Rocco most certainly saved three officer's lives that night that also received injuries during the incident. \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite valiant efforts from an Emergency Veterinary Clinic Rocco succumbed to his injuries on January 30th, 2014.

Millions of American children live in poverty through no fault of their own.  The best way for them to get out of poverty is through a good education.  The best way for them to achieve good grades is to study on a full, satisfied stomach.  Throwing away poor students lunches is humiliating, sadistic and abusive.  It teaches children that their health is worth less than a debt of a few dollars, a debt for which they are not responsible.

However, as with immigration, job creation, social security, tax reform, and the right to privacy, a gridlocked Congress has failed to act.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis petition requests President Obama follow through with the promise in his State of the Union to act where Congress wont.

This petition aims to persuade the Obama Administration to eliminate the limit and instead allow citizens to deduct 100% of the interest paid to student loan lenders over the course of the tax year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nResearch shows that Americans owe more than $1 trillion in student loan debt, and that this burden affects the less affluent to a greater extent because student loans are usually the only way to finance a college education.  Eliminating the $2,500 limit would leave people with more money to spend, thereby creating an economic stimulus; and it would be consistent with the public positions of this Administration on the value of a college education and helping the middle class.\",\"Currently, US citizens are waiting in excess of 10 months for their I-130 and I-129F petitions to be adjudicated, due to a backlog of over 400,000 cases.

The public realizes that prevention of illness and disease is much better than trying to treat their health problems after they occur.  NDs are primary care physicians who practice preventive health care using natural products. They are also experts at treating chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Not only does this form of medicine provide quality healthcare but it is also very cost effective. Studies show substantial reductions in costs - often over 30% - to health plans that integrate NDs and CAM into their plans.

In Crimea there are 22 orphanages with 3600 children. An eyewitness report indicates Russian soldiers are being barracked in orphanages, as well as using these areas to store weapons and food. These developments raise two concerns, first using these children as human shields and second, the possibility of abuse, both physical and sexual. When Roman has spoken with officials, they acknowledge there is no plan to protect children in orphanages if military activity escalates. There are no plans for refugee camps. For children in Crimea, some say this is now Russia's problem. In Ukraine, the reality is there are no funds to do these things. \",\"In the last week Speaker of the House Boehner has verbally made it clear that he has no intentions of extending unemployment benefits when he claimed the work load would be to much.

People living with uncontrolled seizures have reported beneficial effects and reduced seizure activity when using medical marijuana. A lack of research is a major concern for public health and patient safety, consistent dosage, and potential side effects.  However, the hope provided for some is highly sought by families in need.  Unfortunately, because marijuana-based products including the non-psychoactive cannabidiol are Schedule I drugs, it is very difficult for researchers to perform needed studies.  We urge the Obama administration to ask DEA to reschedule marijuana products so researchers can study the benefits and side effects of this treatment option that could potentially help millions of people living with epilepsy.\",\"More than 30% of females serving in the military are of a race other than white.

Current FMLA laws protect a women's job for 12 weeks, however, they do not entitle her to earn any of her pay while on that leave.

It would allow women to stay home with their babies longer, which not only encourages bonding, but encourages a longer period of breasfeeding, which in turn has an abundance of benefits for baby and mom. The Obama adminstration has been very focused on improving health care.

Instead of making the portions small the government should have kids exercise more, helping them to burn the calories they are consuming.

In many circumstances, the refs have made calls that were absurd and they've made calls that were picked up with no explanation. For example, the Dallas Cowboys, a team that has been historically mediocre with little to no coaching and player changes, make the playoffs. In August 2014, the VP of NFL officiating was seen coming out of the Dallas Cowboys party bus after partying with the Executive VP/ Director of player personnel, Stephen Jones. On January 4, 2015, in the first round wild card game Detroit at Dallas, there was a pass interference call that was made and later picked up without any explanation favoring Dallas to win. \",\"The officiating in the Dallas Cowboys-Detroit Lions game was terrible and cost the Lions their first playoff win since 1991.  Repeated rules infractions by the Dallas Cowboys were not called throughout the 2nd half of the game. The result of this has had a negative impact to the city of Detroit and the state of Michigan.  We would like the President to make a statement acknowledging that Dallas would not have won this game without the aid of the officials. We would also like the administration to verbally urge the NFL to hold their officials accountable for mistakes by releasing a public grading system that fans and third party observers can view.   \",\"Research & experience suggest medical cannabis helps  with Alzheimer's, Diabetes, epilepsy, cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, HIV, GI disorders, PTSD, eczema, Autism, arthritis, and other conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease remove the whole cannabis plant from the federal government's banned Schedule 1 list.

In a recent chance encounter, he featured a local student in one of the toughest neighborhoods in America.  He followed the student's story all the way to his school and principal.  After that meeting, he set up a fundraiser for the school and in only a matter of days over $1 Million was raised - all because of the work he does and the passion he has discovered with his community - and it's still ongoing! Last year, he took a 50 day trip in partnership with the UN, and brought his millions of followers together in a different way.\",\"DIPG is a deadly pediatric brain tumor with no survivors and no progress in over 35 years.

Over the past 10 years the NIH budget has been decreased by inflation and plain budget cuts due to other government expenditures. NIH is the most prominent funder of cures, treatments and innovative healthcare procedures, devices and medication. It is the single most important funder of America's innovation in the field of medicine, biomedicine and healthcare. It is proven to return over 5 times the federal investment it receives and has directly impacted the welfare of our population and the world. Budget cuts to the NIH has impaired research, forced scientists out of research and if not corrected urgently may compromise the future of our scientific enterprise. \",\"Middle East Christians are facing ongoing persecution and death.

Historic documentation has exposed a complicated troop movement and has helped retell the story of one of the most strategic military attacks by the British Army against an inexperienced American Army. Over 150 American soldiers were slaughtered and their remains lay buried on the battlefield. The site is threatened by poor management practices; it needs to be recognized for its national significance.\",\"Fr.
